🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato, a popular online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform.
The main goal is to understand customer preferences, restaurant trends, and factors that affect restaurant ratings and popularity.

Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we clean, process, and visualize the data to gain meaningful insights.

🔹 Objectives of the Project

To clean and preprocess Zomato dataset for analysis.

To explore relationships between restaurant features like price range, online delivery, and ratings.

To identify the most popular cuisines and locations.

To visualize important business insights using charts and graphs.

To understand customer preferences and business trends that can help restaurants improve performance.

🔹 Steps Involved

Data Collection

Dataset sourced from publicly available Zomato data (CSV file).

Data Cleaning

Removing null values, duplicates, and unwanted columns.

Converting string ratings like "4.1/5" into numeric format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding patterns and relationships between features.

Plotting distributions, correlations, and comparisons.

Visualization

Graphs such as bar plots, count plots, pie charts, and histograms are created.

Conclusion & Insights

Key takeaways are derived from the patterns found in the dataset.

🔹 Key Insights (Example)

Most restaurants in Zomato are located in Bangalore, Delhi, and Hyderabad.

North Indian and Chinese cuisines are the most popular.

Restaurants offering online delivery tend to have slightly higher average ratings.

Casual Dining and Quick Bites are the most common restaurant types.

Price range and customer ratings have a moderate correlation — higher prices often correspond to higher ratings.
